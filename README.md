# This code calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height.

# It then categorizes the BMI into different weight classes using conditional statements.

# The BMI is calculated using the formula: weight (kg) / (height (m) \*\* 2).

# The output is formatted to show the BMI value with two decimal places.

# The program uses if-elif-else statements to determine the weight category based on the calculated BMI.

# The categories are:

# - Underweight: BMI < 18.5

# - Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 24.9

# - Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 29.9

# - Obese (Class 1): 30 <= BMI < 34.9

# - Obese (Class 2): 35 <= BMI < 39.9

# - Obese (Class 3): BMI >= 40

# If the input is invalid, it prints "Invalid input".

# The code is structured to handle various BMI ranges and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

# The code is designed to be user-friendly, prompting for input and providing clear output based on the BMI calculation.

# The BMI categories are based on standard medical guidelines, making it a useful tool for assessing body weight relative to height.

# The code is efficient and straightforward, using basic arithmetic and conditional logic to achieve its purpose.

# The program is written in Python, making it easy to run and modify for different inputs or additional features.

# The code can be easily extended to include more features, such as suggestions for weight management or health tips based on the BMI category.

# The BMI calculation and categorization logic can be reused in other health-related applications or tools.

# The code is a practical example of how to use conditional statements in Python to make decisions based on user input.

# The program can be tested with various weight and height inputs to ensure accuracy in BMI calculation and categorization.

# The code is a good exercise for beginners to understand how to work with user input, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements in Python.

# The program can be enhanced with error handling to manage non-numeric inputs or unrealistic values for weight and height.
